# What's the Weather on the North Shore Like?

## Motivation
This is a project which started as a way to better understand my new environment - the North Shore of Oahu.

## Scope Creep
Naturally, it turned into a project to make fun visualizations and try to better learn some advanced backend technologies.

As a person with an affinity for hipster technologies, I was really intrigued by Delta (the database from the fine people over at Databricks). I use this weather app as a way to explore Delta, along with my initial motivation of figuring out when the weather in the North Shore ever leaves a band between 70 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit.
